          <h4>Medway Creek Habitat Project</h4>
          <p>Those of you who have been involved with the brown trout releases over the past few years may recognize this spot on Medway Creek as the release point.</p><br>
          <p>Those of you who have been attending the last few General Meetings will also know that this is part of a 280-metre stretch on which we will be focusing future habitat rehabilitation efforts. We have met with and have the support of the two landowners through which this stretch of Medway Creek flows.</p><br>
          <p>Back in March we put together a short video of our stream walk of Medway Creek, during which we documented areas in need of work and added our initial thoughts.</p><br>
          <p>If you would like to be involved with TRAA projects like this one or one of the many others that we have ongoing, please Contact Us.</p>

          <p>This year we be mixed it up a bit by having the Annual TRAA Paddle & Fish on Sharon Creek Reservoir. A thunderstorm threatened but only gave us a few minutes of rain to cool us off.</p><br>
          <p>Fish targeted were largemouth bass, crappie and other panfish as well as some bruiser carp. Many bass were caught with some crappies mixed in to make it interesting. Paul Holmes ended up with the largest fish, a nice smallmouth bass.</p><br>
          <p>A BBQ lunch followed with Rick Ornato supplying the grill and the cooking expertise - Thanks Rick!</p>

          <h4>Stream Habitat Work Party</h4>
          <p>We were very excited to have a group from the MNRF's Stewardship Youth Rangers Program to do some work on Komoka Creek. This program gives groups of 16 or 17 year-olds an opportunity to spend 8 weeks working outdoors on natural resource management projects in their own community.</p><br>
          <p>They worked on clearing a section of Komoka Creek upstream of the TRAA trout hatchery.  A major tree had fallen and a lot of the bank went with it. This created a blockage and was diverting the stream, increasing the likelihood of further bank side damage and erosion.</p><br>
          <p>We were also fairly certain that this was a barrier to migratory and resident fish passage.</p>

          <h4>Work Party - Hatchery Roof</h4>
          <p>As most members already know, a large tree was blown down during high winds on May 2nd. Ironically, barely a week before this happened, we had already removed a couple of dead trees that had been identified as potential hazards to the hatchery.</p><br>
          <p>At the time, we thought this tree wasn't a threat as it was well up the hill and well off to one side. It unfortunately glanced off of a couple of other trees as it fell, steering it directly on to the hatchery roof!</p><br>
          <p>The resulting damage, shown in this picture after the tree was removed, will required the replacement of these metal roof panels and the plywood sheathing underneath them. A couple of the roof trusses also needed to be repaired.</p><br>
          <p>It was an incredibly hot morning but the job was finished in record time. There were materials left over for the tool shed roof as well but that will be another day!</p>

          <p>This year we were pleased to welcome visitors from Chipewas of the Thames First Nation, to tour the trout hatchery and assist us with the release of more than 40,000 rainbow trout.</p><br>
          <p>Everyone was thrilled that the bald eagles with their young ones were keeping an eye on the proceedings at the release site.</p><br>
          <p>This was another successful year and those volunteers on the trout hatchery rotation are to be commended. The trout hatchery will undergo roof repairs as a result of a damaging blow from a fallen tree. Otherwise, the hatchery will be idle for the summer except for routine maintenance.</p>

          <h4>Brook Trout Release</h4>
          <p>The brook trout fingerlings went on the annual road trip throughout rural areas northeast of London to be released into several different cold water tributaries. These were brook trout eggs that we harvested with folks from the Upper Thames Conservation Authority (UTRCA) to be raised in the TRAA trout hatchery.</p><br>
          <p>Thanks to everyone that has put in their time and effort to collect the brook trout eggs, monitor them in the hatchery and participate in the release.</p><br>
          <p>Members Rob and Owen Huber, Stan Gibbs, and Bill Vandewetering did most of the transfer and transportation duties with the support of the Upper Thames Conservation Authority, Ministry of Natural Resources.</p><br>
          <p>Special thanks to all of the landowners for being involved with the habitat improvements of these little coldwater streams into which these trout were released.</p>
